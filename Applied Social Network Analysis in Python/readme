# --Applied Social Network Analysis in Python--


Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a field of study concerned with the analysis of social structures using network and graph theories. It can be applied to study the relationships between individuals, groups, organizations, and even entire societies. In Python, there are several libraries and packages that can be used to perform SNA, including:

NetworkX: This is a comprehensive library for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks. It supports a wide range of graph formats and provides a rich set of algorithms for analyzing networks.

NetworkX is a powerful library for the creation and analysis of complex networks, and supports a wide range of network types, including:

Undirected Graphs: An undirected graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges, where edges do not have a direction.

Directed Graphs: A directed graph, also known as a digraph, is a collection of nodes connected by directed edges, where edges have a direction and represent a one-way relationship.

Weighted Graphs: A weighted graph is a type of graph where each edge has a weight or cost associated with it.

Multi-Graphs: A multi-graph is a type of graph where there can be multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.

Multi-DiGraphs: A multi-DiGraph is a type of directed graph where there can be multiple directed edges between the same pair of nodes.

Bipartite Graphs: A bipartite graph is a type of graph where nodes can be divided into two sets, and edges only connect nodes from different sets.

Hybrid Graphs: NetworkX also allows for the creation of hybrid graphs, which are graphs that contain a combination of different types of edges, such as directed and undirected edges, weighted and unweighted edges, and so on.

igraph: This is a library for creating and analyzing complex network graphs. It provides a high-level interface for creating, manipulating, and analyzing networks, as well as a rich set of algorithms for network analysis.

Gephi: This is a powerful and open-source platform for visualizing and exploring large networks. It can be used with Python through its Python API, which allows for the creation and manipulation of graphs in Gephi from a Python environment.

NodeXL: This is a free, open-source template for Microsoft Excel that makes it easy to perform network analysis on social network data.

Pyvis: This is a high-level library for creating interactive network visualizations in Python. It provides a simple API for creating and styling networks, as well as a rich set of algorithms for network analysis.

These libraries can be used to perform a wide range of tasks in SNA, including graph creation, centrality measures, community detection, and network visualization. The choice of library will depend on the specific needs and requirements of your project, as well as your preferred programming language and experience level.
